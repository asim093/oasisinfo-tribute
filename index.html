            Quaid-e-Azam, a title that means "Great Leader" in Urdu, is the honorific name given to Muhammad Ali Jinnah,
            the
            founding father of Pakistan. Here's a brief biography of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah:
        </p>

        <h3>
            Early Life:
        </h3>

        <p>
            Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, which was then part of British India. His
            father, Jinnahbhai Poonja, was a prosperous merchant
        </p>


        <h3>Education and Legal Career:</h3>
        <p>Jinnah studied law in London and, after completing his studies, he became a barrister in England in 1896.
            He returned to India and established a successful legal practice in Bombay (now Mumbai).</p>

        <h3> Political Career:</h3>

        <p> Jinnah initially entered politics as a member of the Indian National Congress, a party advocating for Indian
            self-rule.
            He later joined the Muslim League, a party that sought to protect the rights and interests of Muslims within
            a
            predominantly Hindu-majority India.
            Jinnah's leadership in the Muslim League, especially his role in the 1940 Lahore Resolution, played a
            pivotal
            role in the demand for a separate Muslim state.</p>


        <h3>Founding of Pakistan:</h3>
        <p> Jinnah's efforts and leadership culminated in the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, as a separate
            nation for Muslims.
            He became Pakistan's first Governor-General and later its first President.</p>


        <h3Death:</h3>
            <p>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's health deteriorated due to his lifelong struggle for Pakistan's
                independence and his work as its leader.
                He passed away on September 11, 1948, in Karachi, just one year after Pakistan's creation.</p>

            <!-- <h3>Legacy:</h3> -->
            <p>Quaid-e-Azam is widely revered in Pakistan as the Father of the Nation.
                His vision and leadership played a crucial role in the establishment of Pakistan as an independent
                nation for
                Muslims. Jinnah's principles of unity, faith, and discipline remain fundamental to the Pakistani
                national ethos.
           Muhammad Ali Jinnah's life and work are celebrated annually on December 25th, his
                birthday, in Pakistan. His
                legacy continues to shape the nation's history and identity.</p>
